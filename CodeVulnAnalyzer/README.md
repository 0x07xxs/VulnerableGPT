# VulnerableGPT

This is a code analyzer that looks for any common vulnerabilities in your code. This is using GPT-4 if you do not have any funds in your account switch it to GPT-3. 
Overall this project is used to look for common vulnerabilities ONLY by any means this program is just a side project I made. Do keep in mind AI may produce innacurate results.
